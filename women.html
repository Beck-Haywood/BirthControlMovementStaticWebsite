                Because of Sanger's position on eugenics, people believed she was racist. At the time many white eugenic promoters were claiming race should be a factor in preventing birth, however Sanger made it clear she did not agree with it.</p>
                <p class="q">“I admire the courage of a government that takes a stand on sterilization of the unfit and second, my admiration is subject to the interpretation of the word ‘unfit.’ If by ‘unfit’ is meant the physical or mental defects of a human being, that is an admirable gesture, 
                but if ‘unfit’ refers to races or religions, then that is another matter, which I frankly deplore” (Katz, 1995, 47).</p>
